# This message contains a description of a grasp that would be used

# approach it, grip it, etc.  This message does not contain any
# information about a "grasp point" (a position ON the object).
# Whatever generates this message should have already combined
# information about grasp points with information about the geometry
# of the end-effector to compute the grasp_pose in this message.

# A name for this grasp
string id

# The internal posture of the hand for the pre-grasp
# only positions are used
trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory pre_grasp_posture

# The internal posture of the hand for the grasp
# positions and efforts are used
trajectory_msgs/JointTrajectory grasp_posture

# The position of the end-effector for the grasp.  This is the pose of
# the "parent_link" of the end-effector, not actually the pose of any
# link *in* the end-effector.  Typically this would be the pose of the
# most distal wrist link before the hand (end-effector) links began.
geometry_msgs/PoseStamped grasp_pose

# The estimated probability of success for this grasp, or some other
# measure of how "good" it is.
float64 grasp_quality

# The approach direction to take before picking an object
GripperTranslation pre_grasp_approach

# The retreat direction to take after a grasp has been completed (object is attached)
GripperTranslation post_grasp_retreat

# The retreat motion to perform when releasing the object; this information
# is not necessary for the grasp itself, but when releasing the object,
# the information will be necessary. The grasp used to perform a pickup
# is returned as part of the result, so this information is available for 
# later use.
GripperTranslation post_place_retreat

# the maximum contact force to use while grasping (<=0 to disable)
float32 max_contact_force

# an optional list of obstacles that we have semantic information about
# and that can be touched/pushed/moved in the course of grasping
